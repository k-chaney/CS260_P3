# CS260_P3
Programming assignment 3 for CS260

Assign yourself to 40 points worth of work. Don't take what has been claimed already. Make use of the folder structure that is in place. Update the readme with how to run your code. Python or C++ doesn't matter to me, just has to work.


Problem 1: The python file has all the program coded and the output of the file will give the answer of the best constants and explanation. Just type:
           python problem1.py


Problem 4: The supplement files for problem 4 are AliceInWonderland.txt and list_array.py. Make sure they have the same path as problem4.py does. Then just simply type:
            python problem4.py
The output will explain how the code works and the size of tries.
